# Supabase Data Structure Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the data structure within the Supabase project. It is intended to be used as a reference for development and for a future Data Science project aimed at analyzing and predicting post performance.

## 1. Data Flow Overview

The data in this project follows a two-stage pipeline:

1.  **Raw Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested from various sources and stored in "raw" tables.
    *   **Notion**: A significant portion of the data is synced from various Notion databases. The `notion_supabase_sync.py` script handles this process, dynamically creating and updating tables in Supabase based on the Notion database structures.
    *   **Social Media APIs**: Other scripts (presumably in the `social_client` directory) pull data directly from social media platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) and store it in platform-specific tables (e.g., `linkedin_posts`, `instagram_profile`).

2.  **Data Consolidation**: SQL scripts (`posts_consolidator.sql` and `profile_aggregator.sql`) are run to process the raw data from the various platform-specific tables and create aggregated, analysis-ready tables: `posts` and `profile`.

```
[Notion DBs] ---> [notion_supabase_sync.py] ---> [notion_* tables] --\
                                                                     |
[Social APIs] --> [social_api_client.py] --> [platform_* tables] --+--> [SQL Scripts] --> [Consolidated Tables]
                                                                     |                        (posts, profile)
                                                                     /
```

## 2. Table Definitions

The following sections describe the tables in the Supabase database.

### 2.1. Consolidated Tables

These tables are the primary source for data analysis. They contain aggregated data from various platforms.

#### `posts`

This table consolidates post-related metrics from all social media platforms, with one record per day. The data is pivoted to have separate columns for each platform and for video vs. non-video content.

-   **Primary Key**: `date`

| Column | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `date` | `date` | The date of the consolidated record. |
| `post_id_linkedin_no_video` | `text` | The ID of the non-video post on LinkedIn for that day. |
| `posted_at_linkedin_no_video`| `date` | The exact posting date for the non-video LinkedIn post. |
| `num_likes_linkedin_no_video`| `integer` | Number of likes for the non-video LinkedIn post. |
| `num_comments_linkedin_no_video`| `integer` | Number of comments for the non-video LinkedIn post. |
| `num_reshares_linkedin_no_video`| `integer` | Number of reshares for the non-video LinkedIn post. |
| `post_id_instagram_no_video` | `text` | The ID of the non-video post on Instagram. |
| ... | `...` | ...and so on for Instagram, Twitter, Substack, and Threads (non-video). |
| `post_id_linkedin_video` | `text` | The ID of the video post on LinkedIn for that day. |
| `posted_at_linkedin_video` | `date` | The exact posting date for the video LinkedIn post. |
| ... | `...` | ...and so on for all platforms (video). |

*(Note: The table contains a large number of columns. The pattern shown above is repeated for `instagram`, `twitter`, `substack`, and `threads`, for both `_no_video` and `_video` post types.)*

#### `profile`

This table consolidates daily follower counts from all social media platforms.

-   **Primary Key**: `date`

| Column | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `date` | `date` | The date of the consolidated record. |
| `num_followers_linkedin` | `integer` | Total number of followers on LinkedIn for that day. |
| `num_followers_instagram` | `integer` | Total number of followers on Instagram for that day. |
| `num_followers_twitter` | `integer` | Total number of followers on Twitter for that day. |
| `num_followers_substack` | `integer` | Total number of followers on Substack for that day. |
| `num_followers_threads` | `integer` | Total number of followers on Threads for that day. |

### 2.2. Raw Data Tables

These tables contain the raw data ingested from various sources before consolidation.

#### 2.2.1. Platform-Specific Tables (Inferred)

These tables are the direct inputs for the consolidated tables. Their schema is inferred from the consolidation SQL scripts.

-   **`linkedin_posts`** (`post_id`, `posted_at`, `num_likes`, `num_comments`, `num_reshares`, `is_video`)
-   **`instagram_posts`** (`post_id`, `posted_at`, `num_likes`, `num_comments`, `is_video`)
-   **`twitter_posts`** (`post_id`, `posted_at`, `num_likes`, `num_comments`, `num_reshares`, `is_video`)
-   **`substack_posts`** (`post_id`, `posted_at`, `num_likes`, `num_comments`, `num_reshares`, `is_video`)
-   **`threads_posts`** (`post_id`, `posted_at`, `num_likes`, `num_comments`, `num_reshares`, `is_video`)
-   **`linkedin_profile`** (`date`, `num_followers`, `platform`, `data_type`)
-   **`instagram_profile`** (`date`, `num_followers`, `platform`, `data_type`)
-   **`twitter_profile`** (`date`, `num_followers`, `platform`, `data_type`)
-   **`substack_profile`** (`date`, `num_followers`, `platform`, `data_type`)
-   **`threads_profile`** (`date`, `num_followers`, `platform`, `data_type`)

#### 2.2.2. Notion-Synced Tables

These tables are synced from Notion databases, as specified in `notion/notion_database_list.json` where `"replication": true`.

**Common Table Structure**

All tables synced from Notion share a common set of columns:

| Column | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `notion_id` | `text` | The Notion page ID (UUID). **Primary Key**. |
| `created_time` | `timestamp with time zone` | Timestamp of when the page was created in Notion. |
| `last_edited_time`| `timestamp with time zone`| Timestamp of when the page was last edited in Notion. |
| `archived` | `boolean` | Whether the page is archived in Notion. |
| `notion_data_jsonb`| `jsonb` | A JSON blob containing any complex data types (lists, dicts) or properties that could not be mapped to a standard column type. |

**Dynamically Generated Columns**

In addition to the common columns, each table has columns that are dynamically generated based on the properties of the corresponding Notion database. The column names are a "normalized" version of the Notion property name (lowercase, spaces replaced with underscores).

The mapping from Notion property types to PostgreSQL data types is as follows:

| Notion Property Type | PostgreSQL Data Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| Title, Rich Text, URL, Email, Phone | `text` |
| Number | `bigint` or `double precision` |
| Select, Status | `text` |
| Date | `timestamp with time zone` |
| Checkbox | `boolean` |
| Formula (String, Number, Boolean, Date) | `text`, `double precision`, `boolean`, `timestamp with time zone` |
| Multi-Select, Relation, People, Files, Rollup (Array) | Stored in `notion_data_jsonb` |

**List of Replicated Notion Tables**

The following tables are synced from Notion:

-   `notion_editorial`
-   `notion_articles`
-   `notion_books`
-   `notion_books_recommendations`
-   `notion_clips`
-   `notion_comments`
-   `notion_companies`
-   `notion_concepts`
-   `notion_connections`
-   `notion_episodes`
-   `notion_illustrations`
-   `notion_interactions`
-   `notion_newsletter`
-   `notion_posts`
-   `notion_visual_types`
-   `notion_wins_and_features`

**Example: `notion_posts` (Hypothetical Schema)**

Based on a typical "posts" database in Notion, the schema for `notion_posts` might look like this:

| Column | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `notion_id` | `text` | **Primary Key** |
| `created_time` | `timestamp with time zone` | (Common column) |
| `last_edited_time` | `timestamp with time zone` | (Common column) |
| `archived` | `boolean` | (Common column) |
| `notion_data_jsonb` | `jsonb` | (Common column) |
| `name` | `text` | The title of the post (from a 'Title' property). |
| `status` | `text` | The publishing status (e.g., "Draft", "Published") (from a 'Select' or 'Status' property). |
| `publish_date` | `timestamp with time zone` | The date the post was or is to be published (from a 'Date' property). |
| `platform` | `text` | The target platform (from a 'Select' property). |
| `related_clip` | `jsonb` | Relation to the `notion_clips` table (stored in the JSONB column). |

## 3. Relationships

-   The **consolidated tables** (`posts`, `profile`) are derived from the **platform-specific tables**.
-   The **platform-specific tables** are populated by external API clients and the Notion sync process.
-   Within the **Notion-synced tables**, relationships are not enforced with foreign key constraints at the database level. Instead, they are stored as arrays of Notion page IDs within the `notion_data_jsonb` column (for 'Relation' properties). Any joins between these tables must be performed in the application or query layer by linking `table_a.notion_id` with values from `table_b.notion_data_jsonb`.
