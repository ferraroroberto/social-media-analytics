## 🗂️ Understanding the Project Structure

Before diving into code, let's understand **why** this project is organized this way:

```
src/
├── data/           # Data access layer - connects to databases
├── features/       # Feature engineering - transforms raw data
├── models/         # Machine learning models - learns patterns
├── api/            # Web interface - makes predictions available
└── utils/          # Configuration and helpers
tests/              # Test scripts for learning and validation
```

**Why this structure?** Data science projects follow a pipeline: Data → Features → Models → Predictions. Each folder represents one stage. The `tests/` folder contains educational scripts that demonstrate each component.

---

## 🔌 Step 1: Data Layer - Understanding Data Sources

### What We're Learning
- How to connect to databases
- How to structure data queries
- How to handle different data formats

### The Database Connection (`src/data/database.py`)

**What it does:** Creates a connection to Supabase (PostgreSQL database) and provides methods to fetch data.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Client Pattern:** One class handles all database operations
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data (URLs, keys) stored outside code
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure when database is unavailable

**Let's explore it step by step:**

```python
# Open src/data/database.py and look at the SupabaseClient class
class SupabaseClient:
    def __init__(self):
        # Gets credentials from environment variables
        self.url = os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL")
        self.key = os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")
        
        # Creates connection
        self.client: Client = create_client(self.url, self.key)
```

**Why environment variables?** 
- Security: Credentials never in code
- Flexibility: Different settings for development/production
- Team collaboration: Each developer can have their own database

**Try it yourself:**
```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
```

**How to get your Supabase credentials:**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in
   - Navigate to your project: `project-name`

2. **Get your API keys:**
   - In your project dashboard, go to **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
   - Click on **API** in the settings menu
   - You'll see three keys:
     - **Project URL** → Copy to `SUPABASE_URL`
     - **anon public** → Copy to `SUPABASE_KEY` 
     - **service_role secret** → Copy to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

3. **Update your .env file:**
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://project-name.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

**⚠️ Important:** The service role key bypasses all security policies, so keep it secret and never commit it to version control!

### Test Your Connection

Now let's verify everything is working! Here's how to test your Supabase connection:

**Step 1: Install required packages**
```bash
pip install python-dotenv supabase pandas
```

**Step 2: Run the connection test**
```bash
python test_supabase_connection.py
```

**What the test does:**
- ✅ **Connects to Supabase** using your credentials
- 🔍 **Checks key tables** (posts, profile, platform-specific tables)
- 📊 **Shows table structure** (column names and types)
- 📈 **Displays sample data** (first few records)

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ **Connection successful** message appears
- 📊 **Table structures** are displayed
- 📈 **Sample data** is shown (even if some tables are empty)

**If the test passes:** You're ready to start the project! 🎉

**If you get errors:** Check your `.env` file and ensure all keys are correct.

**What the data looks like:**
The `posts` table has columns like:
- `num_likes_linkedin_no_video` - engagement metrics
- `date` - when the post was made
- Platform-specific columns for different social networks

**Why this structure?** Social media data is naturally time-series (daily posts) with multiple platforms and content types.

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Feature Engineering - Transforming Raw Data

### What We're Learning
- How to create features that help models learn
- Time-series feature engineering
- Data preprocessing techniques
- How to test and validate feature creation

### The Feature Engineer (`src/features/feature_engineering.py`)

**What it does:** Transforms raw data into features that machine learning models can understand.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Temporal Features:** Day of week, month, seasonality
- **Lag Features:** Previous values to capture trends
- **Rolling Statistics:** Moving averages, standard deviations
- **Cyclical Encoding:** Converting circular data (like days) to continuous values

### Testing and Learning Feature Engineering

**What we built:** A comprehensive test script (`tests/test_feature_engineering.py`) that demonstrates every feature engineering technique step-by-step.

**Why this script exists:**
- **Educational:** Shows how each feature is created and why it matters
- **Testing:** Validates that feature engineering works with both sample and real data
- **Interactive:** Lets you choose between sample data and real Supabase data
- **Robust:** Handles missing columns and data variations gracefully

**Let's explore it step by step:**

```python
# Open tests/test_feature_engineering.py
def create_sample_data():
    """Create realistic sample data matching Supabase schema."""
    dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', '2023-12-31', freq='D')
    
    # Create realistic engagement metrics
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'date': dates,
        'num_likes_linkedin_no_video': np.random.randint(10, 1000, len(dates)),
        'num_comments_linkedin_no_video': np.random.randint(0, 100, len(dates)),
        'num_reshares_linkedin_no_video': np.random.randint(0, 50, len(dates)),
        'num_followers_linkedin': np.random.randint(1000, 10000, len(dates))
    })
    
    # Calculate derived engagement metrics
    df['engagement_linkedin_no_video'] = (
        df['num_likes_linkedin_no_video'] + 
        df['num_comments_linkedin_no_video'] * 2 + 
        df['num_reshares_linkedin_no_video'] * 3
    )
    
    return df
```

**Why sample data?**
- **Consistent:** Always has the same structure for learning
- **Controlled:** You know what features should be created
- **Fast:** No database connection needed for initial learning
- **Realistic:** Matches your actual Supabase schema

**Interactive data choice:**
```python
def choose_data_source():
    """Let user choose between sample and real data."""
    print("\n🔍 Choose your data source:")
    print("1. Sample data (created on the spot)")
    print("2. Real data from Supabase database")
    
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1 or 2): ").strip()
    
    if choice == "2":
        return load_real_data_from_supabase()
    else:
        return create_sample_data()
```

**Why both options?**
- **Sample data:** Learn concepts without database setup
- **Real data:** Test with actual data structure and issues
- **Comparison:** See how features work with different data characteristics

### Understanding Feature Types

**1. Temporal Features:**
```python
def demonstrate_temporal_features(df):
    """Show how time-based features are created."""
    fe = FeatureEngineer()
    
    # Create temporal features
    df_with_temporal = fe.create_temporal_features(df)
    
    print("📅 Temporal Features Created:")
    print(f"   - Day of week: {df_with_temporal['day_of_week'].unique()}")
    print(f"   - Month: {df_with_temporal['month'].unique()}")
    print(f"   - Cyclical encoding: month_sin, month_cos")
```

**Why cyclical encoding?** 
- Month 12 (December) is close to Month 1 (January)
- Regular encoding (1, 2, 3... 12) makes December far from January
- Sin/cos encoding creates a circle where December and January are close

**2. Lag Features:**
```python
def demonstrate_lag_features(df):
    """Show how lag features capture temporal patterns."""
    fe = FeatureEngineer()
    
    # Create lag features for engagement
    df_with_lags = fe.create_lag_features(
        df, 
        ['engagement_linkedin_no_video'], 
        lags=[1, 3, 7, 14, 30]
    )
    
    print("⏰ Lag Features Created:")
    print(f"   - 1-day lag: engagement_linkedin_no_video_lag_1")
    print(f"   - 7-day rolling mean: engagement_linkedin_no_video_rolling_mean_7")
```

**Why lag features?** 
- Yesterday's engagement predicts today's engagement
- Rolling averages smooth out daily fluctuations
- Models learn patterns over time, not just current values

**3. Engagement Features:**
```python
def demonstrate_engagement_features(df):
    """Show how engagement metrics are calculated."""
    fe = FeatureEngineer()
    
    # Create engagement features
    df_with_engagement = fe.create_engagement_features(df)
    
    print("📊 Engagement Features Created:")
    print(f"   - Engagement rate: engagement_rate")
    print(f"   - Interaction ratio: interaction_ratio")
    print(f"   - Viral coefficient: viral_coefficient")
```

**4. Cross-Platform Features:**
```python
def demonstrate_cross_platform_features(df):
    """Show how features compare across platforms."""
    fe = FeatureEngineer()
    
    # Create cross-platform features
    df_with_cross = fe.create_cross_platform_features(df)
    
    print("🔄 Cross-Platform Features Created:")
    print(f"   - Platform performance comparison")
    print(f"   - Cross-platform engagement ratios")
```

### Feature Importance Analysis

**What we built:** An interactive feature importance system that explains **why** certain features are ranked higher than others using hard data, not just domain knowledge.

**The process:**
```python
def demonstrate_feature_importance(df):
    """Interactive feature importance analysis."""
    
    # 1. List available features
    numeric_features = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()
    print(f"📋 Available numeric features: {len(numeric_features)}")
    
    # 2. Let user choose target variable
    target_variable = input(f"Choose target variable (default: num_likes_linkedin_no_video): ").strip()
    if not target_variable:
        target_variable = 'num_likes_linkedin_no_video'
    
    # 3. Analyze each feature with hard data
    feature_scores = {}
    
    for feature in numeric_features:
        if feature == target_variable:
            continue
            
        # Calculate feature scores
        variance_score = calculate_variance_score(df[feature])
        completeness_score = calculate_completeness_score(df[feature])
        distribution_score = calculate_distribution_score(df[feature])
        complexity_score = calculate_complexity_score(feature)
        
        # Composite score
        composite_score = (
            0.3 * variance_score + 
            0.25 * completeness_score + 
            0.25 * distribution_score + 
            0.2 * complexity_score
        )
        
        feature_scores[feature] = {
            'composite_score': composite_score,
            'variance_score': variance_score,
            'completeness_score': completeness_score,
            'distribution_score': distribution_score,
            'complexity_score': complexity_score
        }
```

**Hard data analysis includes:**

1. **Feature Variance Analysis:**
   - Shows variance, standard deviation, mean
   - Coefficient of variation (CV = std/mean)
   - Higher variance = more information potential

2. **Missing Value Analysis:**
   - Count and percentage of missing values
   - Completeness score (1 - missing_percentage)
   - More complete features are more reliable

3. **Correlation with Target:**
   - Pearson correlation coefficient
   - Strength and direction of relationship
   - Higher absolute correlation = stronger predictive power

4. **Feature Distribution Analysis:**
   - Outlier detection using IQR method
   - Outlier percentage
   - Well-distributed features are more stable

5. **Feature Engineering Complexity:**
   - Simple features (raw data) get higher scores
   - Complex features (lag, rolling) get lower scores
   - Balance between information and complexity

**Mathematical ranking formula:**
```
Composite Score = 0.3 × Variance + 0.25 × Completeness + 0.25 × Distribution + 0.2 × Complexity
```

**Why this formula?**
- **Variance (30%):** High variance features contain more information
- **Completeness (25%):** Complete features are more reliable
- **Distribution (25%):** Well-distributed features are more stable
- **Complexity (20%):** Simpler features are preferred (Occam's razor)

**Try it yourself:**
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test
cd tests
python test_feature_engineering.py

# Choose option 1 for sample data first
# Then try option 2 with real Supabase data
```

**What you'll learn:**
- How each feature type is created
- Why certain features are more important
- How to handle missing or inconsistent data
- How to validate feature engineering results

### Testing Your Feature Engineering

**What we built:** The `tests/test_feature_engineering.py` script serves multiple purposes:

1. **Educational Demonstration:** Shows each feature type step-by-step
2. **Interactive Testing:** Choose between sample and real data
3. **Robust Validation:** Handles data variations gracefully
4. **Feature Importance Analysis:** Data-driven ranking with mathematical scoring

**How to use it:**

```bash

```

**What happens during the test:**

1. **Data Source Selection:** Choose between sample or real data
2. **Feature Creation:** Watch each feature type being created
3. **Interactive Analysis:** Select target variables for prediction
4. **Mathematical Ranking:** See feature importance based on hard data
5. **Comparison:** Compare data-driven vs. domain knowledge rankings

**Key learning outcomes:**
- **Temporal Features:** How time affects engagement
- **Lag Features:** How past performance predicts future
- **Engagement Metrics:** How to calculate meaningful ratios
- **Feature Importance:** Why certain features matter more
- **Data Handling:** How to work with real-world data issues

**For production use:**
- Use option 2 to test with real Supabase data
- Validate feature creation with actual data structure
- Test robustness with missing or inconsistent data
- Verify feature importance rankings with real metrics

## 🤖 Step 3: Machine Learning Models - Learning from Data

### What We're Learning
- How different algorithms work
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model persistence

### The Base Model (`src/models/base_model.py`)

**What it does:** Provides a common interface for all machine learning models, ensuring consistency in training, prediction, and evaluation.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Abstract Base Class:** Defines what all models must do
- **Inheritance:** Specific models (Random Forest, XGBoost) inherit common functionality
- **MLflow Integration:** Tracks experiments and model versions
- **Feature Importance:** Understands which features matter most

**The training process:**
```python
def fit(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series) -> 'BaseModel':
    # X = features (day of week, month, lag features, etc.)
    # y = target (number of likes, comments, etc.)
    
    # Clean data (remove rows with missing values)
    mask = ~(X.isnull().any(axis=1) | y.isnull())
    X_clean = X[mask]
    y_clean = y[mask]
    
    # Train the model
    self.model.fit(X_clean, y_clean)
    self.is_fitted = True
```

**Why clean data?** 
- Machine learning models can't handle missing values
- Removing bad data is better than guessing
- Quality of training data determines model performance

**Model evaluation:**
```python
def evaluate(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series) -> Dict[str, float]:
    predictions = self.predict(X)
    
    return {
        'mae': mean_absolute_error(y, predictions),      # Average error
        'rmse': np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, predictions)),  # Penalizes large errors
        'r2': r2_score(y, predictions)                  # How well model explains variance
    }
```

**Understanding metrics:**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average difference between prediction and actual
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):** Penalizes large errors more heavily
- **R² (R-squared):** Percentage of variance explained by the model (0-1, higher is better)

**Try it yourself:**
```python
# Simple example
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# Create simple data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])  # Perfect linear relationship

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict([[6]])
print(f"Prediction for 6: {prediction[0]}")  # Should be 12

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y, predictions)
print(f"MAE: {mae}, R²: {r2}")
```

### Specific Models (`src/models/prediction_models.py`)

**What it does:** Implements different machine learning algorithms, each with strengths and weaknesses.

**Model types and when to use them:**

1. **Random Forest** (`RandomForestModel`)
   - **What it is:** Collection of decision trees, each trained on different data
   - **When to use:** Good baseline, handles non-linear relationships
   - **Pros:** Interpretable, handles missing values
   - **Cons:** Can overfit, slower than linear models

2. **XGBoost** (`XGBoostModel`)
   - **What it is:** Gradient boosting with regularization
   - **When to use:** High performance, complex patterns
   - **Pros:** Very accurate, handles many feature types
   - **Cons:** Can overfit, harder to interpret

3. **Linear Regression** (`LinearRegressionModel`)
   - **What it is:** Straight line through data points
   - **When to use:** Simple relationships, interpretability
   - **Pros:** Fast, interpretable, no overfitting
   - **Cons:** Can't capture complex patterns

**Try different models:**
```python
# Compare models on same data
from src.models.prediction_models import create_model

# Create different model types
rf_model = create_model('random_forest', 'likes')
xgb_model = create_model('xgboost', 'likes')
linear_model = create_model('linear_regression', 'likes')

# Train and compare
models = [rf_model, xgb_model, linear_model]
for model in models:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    metrics = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"{model.model_name}: MAE={metrics['mae']:.2f}, R²={metrics['r2']:.2f}")
```

## 🌐 Step 4: API Layer - Making Predictions Available

### What We're Learning
- How to create web APIs
- Request/response handling
- Data validation
- Error handling

### The Prediction API (`src/api/prediction_api.py`)

**What it does:** Creates a web service that accepts requests and returns predictions, making your machine learning models accessible to other applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- **FastAPI:** Modern Python web framework
- **Pydantic Models:** Automatic data validation
- **REST Endpoints:** Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- **CORS:** Allows web browsers to call your API

**API structure:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    platform: str
    content_type: str
    date: str

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict_engagement(request: PredictionRequest):
    # Validate input
    # Load model
    # Make prediction
    # Return result
```

**Why Pydantic?**
- Automatically validates incoming data
- Converts JSON to Python objects
- Provides clear error messages for invalid data

**Try the API:**
```bash
# Start the API
uvicorn src.api.prediction_api:app --reload

# In another terminal, test it
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform": "linkedin", "content_type": "no_video", "date": "2023-12-01"}'
```

**What happens when you call the API:**
1. **Request comes in:** JSON data arrives at `/predict` endpoint
2. **Validation:** Pydantic checks if data matches `PredictionRequest` model
3. **Processing:** API loads appropriate model and features
4. **Prediction:** Model makes prediction based on input
5. **Response:** JSON with prediction and confidence returned

---

## 📊 Step 5: Dashboard - Visualizing Results

### What We're Learning
- How to create interactive web applications
- Data visualization techniques
- Real-time data integration
- User interface design

### The Dash App (`dash_app/app.py`)

**What it does:** Creates an interactive web dashboard where users can input data and see predictions, visualizations, and insights.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dash:** Python framework for building web apps
- **Plotly:** Interactive charts and graphs
- **Bootstrap:** Responsive design and styling
- **Callbacks:** Dynamic updates based on user input

**Dashboard structure:**
```python
app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])

app.layout = dbc.Container([
    dbc.Tabs([
        dbc.Tab(label="Performance Prediction", children=[...]),
        dbc.Tab(label="Caption Analyzer", children=[...]),
        dbc.Tab(label="Platform Trends", children=[...])
    ])
])
```

**Why tabs?**
- Organizes different types of analysis
- Keeps interface clean and focused
- Allows users to focus on specific tasks

**Interactive components:**
```python
dbc.Dropdown(
    id='platform-dropdown',
    options=[
        {'label': 'LinkedIn', 'value': 'linkedin'},
        {'label': 'Instagram', 'value': 'instagram'}
    ],
    value='linkedin'
)
```

**Callbacks (the magic behind interactivity):**
```python
@app.callback(
    Output('prediction-output', 'children'),
    Input('predict-button', 'n_clicks'),
    State('platform-dropdown', 'value')
)
def update_prediction(n_clicks, platform):
    if n_clicks:
        # Make API call to get prediction
        # Return formatted result
        return f"Predicted engagement for {platform}: ..."
```

**Try the dashboard:**
```bash
# Start dashboard
python dash_app/app.py

# Open browser to http://localhost:8050
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Running the Complete Pipeline

### What We're Learning
- How all components work together
- End-to-end data flow
- Testing and validation
- Performance optimization

### The Complete Workflow

**1. Data Collection**
```bash
# Load data from Supabase
python -c "
from src.data.database import SupabaseClient
client = SupabaseClient()
posts = client.get_posts_data()
print(f'Loaded {len(posts)} posts')
"
```

**2. Feature Engineering**
```bash
# Create features
python -c "
from src.features.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer
from src.data.database import SupabaseClient

# Load data
client = SupabaseClient()
posts = client.get_posts_data()

# Create features
fe = FeatureEngineer()
posts_with_features = fe.create_temporal_features(posts)
posts_with_features = fe.create_lag_features(posts_with_features, ['num_likes_linkedin_no_video'])

print(f'Created {len(posts_with_features.columns)} features')
"
```

**3. Model Training**
```bash
# Train a model
python -c "
from src.models.prediction_models import create_model

## 🔍 Step 7: Understanding Model Performance

### What We're Learning
- How to interpret model results
- Feature importance analysis
- Model comparison techniques
- Overfitting detection

### Evaluating Your Models

**1. Check Basic Metrics**
```python
# Load trained model and evaluate
from src.models.base_model import BaseModel
model = BaseModel.load_model('models/random_forest_likes.joblib')

# Get feature importance
importance = model.get_feature_importance()
for feature, score in sorted(importance.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]:
    print(f"{feature}: {score:.3f}")
```

**2. Understand Feature Importance**
- **High importance:** Feature strongly influences predictions
- **Low importance:** Feature has little impact
- **Unexpected importance:** May indicate data leakage or bugs

**3. Detect Overfitting**
- **Training R² much higher than test R²:** Model memorized training data
- **Solution:** Use simpler model, more regularization, or more training data

**4. Compare Models**
```python
# Compare multiple models
models = ['random_forest', 'xgboost', 'linear_regression']
results = {}

for model_type in models:
    model = create_model(model_type, 'num_likes_linkedin_no_video')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    metrics = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    results[model_type] = metrics

# Find best model
best_model = min(results.keys(), key=lambda x: results[x]['mae'])
print(f"Best model: {best_model} with MAE: {results[best_model]['mae']:.3f}")
```

## 🛠️ Step 8: Customization and Extension

### What We're Learning
- How to modify existing functionality
- Adding new features
- Integrating external data sources
- Scaling the system

### Adding New Features

**1. Create a New Feature Type**
```python
# In src/features/feature_engineering.py
def create_holiday_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame, date_col: str = 'date') -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Create holiday-specific features."""
    df = df.copy()
    
    # Add holiday indicators
    df['is_christmas'] = ((df[date_col].dt.month == 12) & 
                          (df[date_col].dt.day >= 20) & 
                          (df[date_col].dt.day <= 26)).astype(int)
    
    df['is_new_year'] = ((df[date_col].dt.month == 1) & 
                         (df[date_col].dt.day <= 3)).astype(int)
    
    return df
```

**2. Add New Model Type**
```python
# In src/models/prediction_models.py
class NeuralNetworkModel(BaseModel):
    def _create_model(self):
        from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
        return MLPRegressor(
            hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50),
            max_iter=1000,
            random_state=42
        )

# Add to factory function
def create_model(model_type: str, target_column: str, **kwargs) -> BaseModel:
    if model_type == 'neural_network':
        return NeuralNetworkModel(target_column, **kwargs)
    # ... existing code ...
```

**3. Create New API Endpoint**
```python
# In src/api/prediction_api.py
@app.post("/analyze-trends")
async def analyze_trends(request: TrendRequest):
    """Analyze posting trends and patterns."""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## 📈 Step 9: Advanced Concepts

### What We're Learning
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble methods
- Model deployment

### Hyperparameter Tuning

**What are hyperparameters?** Settings that control how models learn (e.g., number of trees in Random Forest, learning rate in XGBoost).

**Why tune them?** Default values are rarely optimal for your specific data.

**Using Optuna for tuning:**
```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    # Define hyperparameter search space
    n_estimators = trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 50, 300)
    max_depth = trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 3, 10)
    
    # Create and train model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        random_state=42
    )
    
    # Evaluate
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

# Run optimization
study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)

print(f"Best parameters: {study.best_params}")
```

### Cross-Validation

**What is it?** Testing model performance on multiple subsets of data to get more reliable estimates.

**Why use it?** Single train/test split can be misleading due to random variation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')
mae_scores = -scores  # Convert to positive MAE

print(f"Cross-validation MAE: {mae_scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {mae_scores.std() * 2:.3f})")
```

## 🎯 Step 10: Production Deployment

### What We're Learning
- Containerization with Docker
- Environment management
- Monitoring and logging
- Scaling considerations

### Docker Deployment

**Why Docker?**
- Consistent environment across machines
- Easy deployment and scaling
- Isolated dependencies

**Building and running:**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t content-predictor .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8050:8050 content-predictor
```

**Docker Compose for multiple services:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - SUPABASE_URL=${SUPABASE_URL}
      - SUPABASE_KEY=${SUPABASE_KEY}
  
  dashboard:
    build: .
    command: python dash_app/app.py
    ports:
      - "8050:8050"
```

## 🔄 Step 11: Continuous Learning and Improvement

### What We're Learning
- Model retraining strategies
- A/B testing
- Performance monitoring
- Feedback loops

### Model Retraining

**When to retrain?**
- New data available
- Performance degradation
- Business requirements change

**Automated retraining:**
```python
# Check model performance daily
def check_model_performance():
    current_metrics = evaluate_current_model()
    if current_metrics['mae'] > threshold:
        retrain_model()
        log_model_update()
```
