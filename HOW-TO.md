## 🗂️ Understanding the Project Structure

Before diving into code, let's understand **why** this project is organized this way:

```
src/
├── data/           # Data access layer - connects to databases
├── features/       # Feature engineering - transforms raw data
├── models/         # Machine learning models - learns patterns
├── api/            # Web interface - makes predictions available
└── utils/          # Configuration and helpers
```

**Why this structure?** Data science projects follow a pipeline: Data → Features → Models → Predictions. Each folder represents one stage.

---

## 🔌 Step 1: Data Layer - Understanding Data Sources

### What We're Learning
- How to connect to databases
- How to structure data queries
- How to handle different data formats

### The Database Connection (`src/data/database.py`)

**What it does:** Creates a connection to Supabase (PostgreSQL database) and provides methods to fetch data.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Client Pattern:** One class handles all database operations
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data (URLs, keys) stored outside code
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure when database is unavailable

**Let's explore it step by step:**

```python
# Open src/data/database.py and look at the SupabaseClient class
class SupabaseClient:
    def __init__(self):
        # Gets credentials from environment variables
        self.url = os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL")
        self.key = os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")
        
        # Creates connection
        self.client: Client = create_client(self.url, self.key)
```

**Why environment variables?** 
- Security: Credentials never in code
- Flexibility: Different settings for development/production
- Team collaboration: Each developer can have their own database

**Try it yourself:**
```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
```

**What the data looks like:**
The `posts` table has columns like:
- `num_likes_linkedin_no_video` - engagement metrics
- `date` - when the post was made
- Platform-specific columns for different social networks

**Why this structure?** Social media data is naturally time-series (daily posts) with multiple platforms and content types.

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Feature Engineering - Transforming Raw Data

### What We're Learning
- How to create features that help models learn
- Time-series feature engineering
- Data preprocessing techniques

### The Feature Engineer (`src/features/feature_engineering.py`)

**What it does:** Transforms raw data into features that machine learning models can understand.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Temporal Features:** Day of week, month, seasonality
- **Lag Features:** Previous values to capture trends
- **Rolling Statistics:** Moving averages, standard deviations
- **Cyclical Encoding:** Converting circular data (like days) to continuous values

**Let's break down temporal features:**

```python
def create_temporal_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame, date_col: str = 'date') -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Convert string dates to datetime objects
    df[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(df[date_col])
    
    # Extract components
    df['day_of_week'] = df[date_col].dt.dayofweek  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
    df['month'] = df[date_col].dt.month             # 1-12
    df['quarter'] = df[date_col].dt.quarter         # 1-4
    
    # Cyclical encoding (why? because month 12 is close to month 1)
    df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
    df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
```

**Why cyclical encoding?** 
- Month 12 (December) is close to Month 1 (January)
- Regular encoding (1, 2, 3... 12) makes December far from January
- Sin/cos encoding creates a circle where December and January are close

**Try it yourself:**
```python
# In Python console
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', '2023-12-31', freq='D')
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates})
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)

# Plot to see the cyclical pattern
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(df['month_sin'], df['month_cos'])
plt.show()
```

**Lag features explained:**
```python
def create_lag_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame, target_cols: List[str], lags: List[int] = [1, 3, 7, 14, 30]):
    for col in target_cols:
        for lag in lags:
            # Yesterday's value
            df[f'{col}_lag_{lag}'] = df[col].shift(lag)
            
            # Rolling average over last N days
            df[f'{col}_rolling_mean_{lag}'] = df[col].rolling(window=lag, min_periods=1).mean()
```

**Why lag features?** 
- Yesterday's engagement predicts today's engagement
- Rolling averages smooth out daily fluctuations
- Models learn patterns over time, not just current values

## 🤖 Step 3: Machine Learning Models - Learning from Data

### What We're Learning
- How different algorithms work
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model persistence

### The Base Model (`src/models/base_model.py`)

**What it does:** Provides a common interface for all machine learning models, ensuring consistency in training, prediction, and evaluation.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Abstract Base Class:** Defines what all models must do
- **Inheritance:** Specific models (Random Forest, XGBoost) inherit common functionality
- **MLflow Integration:** Tracks experiments and model versions
- **Feature Importance:** Understands which features matter most

**The training process:**
```python
def fit(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series) -> 'BaseModel':
    # X = features (day of week, month, lag features, etc.)
    # y = target (number of likes, comments, etc.)
    
    # Clean data (remove rows with missing values)
    mask = ~(X.isnull().any(axis=1) | y.isnull())
    X_clean = X[mask]
    y_clean = y[mask]
    
    # Train the model
    self.model.fit(X_clean, y_clean)
    self.is_fitted = True
```

**Why clean data?** 
- Machine learning models can't handle missing values
- Removing bad data is better than guessing
- Quality of training data determines model performance

**Model evaluation:**
```python
def evaluate(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series) -> Dict[str, float]:
    predictions = self.predict(X)
    
    return {
        'mae': mean_absolute_error(y, predictions),      # Average error
        'rmse': np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, predictions)),  # Penalizes large errors
        'r2': r2_score(y, predictions)                  # How well model explains variance
    }
```

**Understanding metrics:**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average difference between prediction and actual
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):** Penalizes large errors more heavily
- **R² (R-squared):** Percentage of variance explained by the model (0-1, higher is better)

**Try it yourself:**
```python
# Simple example
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# Create simple data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])  # Perfect linear relationship

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict([[6]])
print(f"Prediction for 6: {prediction[0]}")  # Should be 12

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y, predictions)
print(f"MAE: {mae}, R²: {r2}")
```

### Specific Models (`src/models/prediction_models.py`)

**What it does:** Implements different machine learning algorithms, each with strengths and weaknesses.

**Model types and when to use them:**

1. **Random Forest** (`RandomForestModel`)
   - **What it is:** Collection of decision trees, each trained on different data
   - **When to use:** Good baseline, handles non-linear relationships
   - **Pros:** Interpretable, handles missing values
   - **Cons:** Can overfit, slower than linear models

2. **XGBoost** (`XGBoostModel`)
   - **What it is:** Gradient boosting with regularization
   - **When to use:** High performance, complex patterns
   - **Pros:** Very accurate, handles many feature types
   - **Cons:** Can overfit, harder to interpret

3. **Linear Regression** (`LinearRegressionModel`)
   - **What it is:** Straight line through data points
   - **When to use:** Simple relationships, interpretability
   - **Pros:** Fast, interpretable, no overfitting
   - **Cons:** Can't capture complex patterns

**Try different models:**
```python
# Compare models on same data
from src.models.prediction_models import create_model

# Create different model types
rf_model = create_model('random_forest', 'likes')
xgb_model = create_model('xgboost', 'likes')
linear_model = create_model('linear_regression', 'likes')

# Train and compare
models = [rf_model, xgb_model, linear_model]
for model in models:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    metrics = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"{model.model_name}: MAE={metrics['mae']:.2f}, R²={metrics['r2']:.2f}")
```

---

## 🌐 Step 4: API Layer - Making Predictions Available

### What We're Learning
- How to create web APIs
- Request/response handling
- Data validation
- Error handling

### The Prediction API (`src/api/prediction_api.py`)

**What it does:** Creates a web service that accepts requests and returns predictions, making your machine learning models accessible to other applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- **FastAPI:** Modern Python web framework
- **Pydantic Models:** Automatic data validation
- **REST Endpoints:** Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- **CORS:** Allows web browsers to call your API

**API structure:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    platform: str
    content_type: str
    date: str

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict_engagement(request: PredictionRequest):
    # Validate input
    # Load model
    # Make prediction
    # Return result
```

**Why Pydantic?**
- Automatically validates incoming data
- Converts JSON to Python objects
- Provides clear error messages for invalid data

**Try the API:**
```bash
# Start the API
uvicorn src.api.prediction_api:app --reload

# In another terminal, test it
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform": "linkedin", "content_type": "no_video", "date": "2023-12-01"}'
```

**What happens when you call the API:**
1. **Request comes in:** JSON data arrives at `/predict` endpoint
2. **Validation:** Pydantic checks if data matches `PredictionRequest` model
3. **Processing:** API loads appropriate model and features
4. **Prediction:** Model makes prediction based on input
5. **Response:** JSON with prediction and confidence returned

---

## 📊 Step 5: Dashboard - Visualizing Results

### What We're Learning
- How to create interactive web applications
- Data visualization techniques
- Real-time data integration
- User interface design

### The Dash App (`dash_app/app.py`)

**What it does:** Creates an interactive web dashboard where users can input data and see predictions, visualizations, and insights.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dash:** Python framework for building web apps
- **Plotly:** Interactive charts and graphs
- **Bootstrap:** Responsive design and styling
- **Callbacks:** Dynamic updates based on user input

**Dashboard structure:**
```python
app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])

app.layout = dbc.Container([
    dbc.Tabs([
        dbc.Tab(label="Performance Prediction", children=[...]),
        dbc.Tab(label="Caption Analyzer", children=[...]),
        dbc.Tab(label="Platform Trends", children=[...])
    ])
])
```

**Why tabs?**
- Organizes different types of analysis
- Keeps interface clean and focused
- Allows users to focus on specific tasks

**Interactive components:**
```python
dbc.Dropdown(
    id='platform-dropdown',
    options=[
        {'label': 'LinkedIn', 'value': 'linkedin'},
        {'label': 'Instagram', 'value': 'instagram'}
    ],
    value='linkedin'
)
```

**Callbacks (the magic behind interactivity):**
```python
@app.callback(
    Output('prediction-output', 'children'),
    Input('predict-button', 'n_clicks'),
    State('platform-dropdown', 'value')
)
def update_prediction(n_clicks, platform):
    if n_clicks:
        # Make API call to get prediction
        # Return formatted result
        return f"Predicted engagement for {platform}: ..."
```

**Try the dashboard:**
```bash
# Start dashboard
python dash_app/app.py

# Open browser to http://localhost:8050
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Running the Complete Pipeline

### What We're Learning
- How all components work together
- End-to-end data flow
- Testing and validation
- Performance optimization

### The Complete Workflow

**1. Data Collection**
```bash
# Load data from Supabase
python -c "
from src.data.database import SupabaseClient
client = SupabaseClient()
posts = client.get_posts_data()
print(f'Loaded {len(posts)} posts')
"
```

**2. Feature Engineering**
```bash
# Create features
python -c "
from src.features.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer
from src.data.database import SupabaseClient

# Load data
client = SupabaseClient()
posts = client.get_posts_data()

# Create features
fe = FeatureEngineer()
posts_with_features = fe.create_temporal_features(posts)
posts_with_features = fe.create_lag_features(posts_with_features, ['num_likes_linkedin_no_video'])

print(f'Created {len(posts_with_features.columns)} features')
"
```

**3. Model Training**
```bash
# Train a model
python -c "
from src.models.prediction_models import create_model
from src.features.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer
from src.data.database import SupabaseClient

# Load and prepare data
client = SupabaseClient()
posts = client.get_posts_data()
fe = FeatureEngineer()
posts_with_features = fe.create_temporal_features(posts)
posts_with_features = fe.create_lag_features(posts_with_features, ['num_likes_linkedin_no_video'])

# Train model
model = create_model('random_forest', 'num_likes_linkedin_no_video')
model.fit(posts_with_features, posts_with_features['num_likes_linkedin_no_video'])

print('Model trained successfully!')
"
```

**4. Make Predictions**
```bash
# Start API and make prediction
uvicorn src.api.prediction_api:app --reload &
sleep 5

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform": "linkedin", "content_type": "no_video", "date": "2023-12-01"}'
```

---

## 🔍 Step 7: Understanding Model Performance

### What We're Learning
- How to interpret model results
- Feature importance analysis
- Model comparison techniques
- Overfitting detection

### Evaluating Your Models

**1. Check Basic Metrics**
```python
# Load trained model and evaluate
from src.models.base_model import BaseModel
model = BaseModel.load_model('models/random_forest_likes.joblib')

# Get feature importance
importance = model.get_feature_importance()
for feature, score in sorted(importance.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]:
    print(f"{feature}: {score:.3f}")
```

**2. Understand Feature Importance**
- **High importance:** Feature strongly influences predictions
- **Low importance:** Feature has little impact
- **Unexpected importance:** May indicate data leakage or bugs

**3. Detect Overfitting**
- **Training R² much higher than test R²:** Model memorized training data
- **Solution:** Use simpler model, more regularization, or more training data

**4. Compare Models**
```python
# Compare multiple models
models = ['random_forest', 'xgboost', 'linear_regression']
results = {}

for model_type in models:
    model = create_model(model_type, 'num_likes_linkedin_no_video')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    metrics = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    results[model_type] = metrics

# Find best model
best_model = min(results.keys(), key=lambda x: results[x]['mae'])
print(f"Best model: {best_model} with MAE: {results[best_model]['mae']:.3f}")
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 8: Customization and Extension

### What We're Learning
- How to modify existing functionality
- Adding new features
- Integrating external data sources
- Scaling the system

### Adding New Features

**1. Create a New Feature Type**
```python
# In src/features/feature_engineering.py
def create_holiday_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame, date_col: str = 'date') -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Create holiday-specific features."""
    df = df.copy()
    
    # Add holiday indicators
    df['is_christmas'] = ((df[date_col].dt.month == 12) & 
                          (df[date_col].dt.day >= 20) & 
                          (df[date_col].dt.day <= 26)).astype(int)
    
    df['is_new_year'] = ((df[date_col].dt.month == 1) & 
                         (df[date_col].dt.day <= 3)).astype(int)
    
    return df
```

**2. Add New Model Type**
```python
# In src/models/prediction_models.py
class NeuralNetworkModel(BaseModel):
    def _create_model(self):
        from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
        return MLPRegressor(
            hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50),
            max_iter=1000,
            random_state=42
        )

# Add to factory function
def create_model(model_type: str, target_column: str, **kwargs) -> BaseModel:
    if model_type == 'neural_network':
        return NeuralNetworkModel(target_column, **kwargs)
    # ... existing code ...
```

**3. Create New API Endpoint**
```python
# In src/api/prediction_api.py
@app.post("/analyze-trends")
async def analyze_trends(request: TrendRequest):
    """Analyze posting trends and patterns."""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

---

## 📈 Step 9: Advanced Concepts

### What We're Learning
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble methods
- Model deployment

### Hyperparameter Tuning

**What are hyperparameters?** Settings that control how models learn (e.g., number of trees in Random Forest, learning rate in XGBoost).

**Why tune them?** Default values are rarely optimal for your specific data.

**Using Optuna for tuning:**
```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    # Define hyperparameter search space
    n_estimators = trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 50, 300)
    max_depth = trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 3, 10)
    
    # Create and train model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        random_state=42
    )
    
    # Evaluate
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    return mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

# Run optimization
study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)

print(f"Best parameters: {study.best_params}")
```

### Cross-Validation

**What is it?** Testing model performance on multiple subsets of data to get more reliable estimates.

**Why use it?** Single train/test split can be misleading due to random variation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')
mae_scores = -scores  # Convert to positive MAE

print(f"Cross-validation MAE: {mae_scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {mae_scores.std() * 2:.3f})")
```

---

## 🎯 Step 10: Production Deployment

### What We're Learning
- Containerization with Docker
- Environment management
- Monitoring and logging
- Scaling considerations

### Docker Deployment

**Why Docker?**
- Consistent environment across machines
- Easy deployment and scaling
- Isolated dependencies

**Building and running:**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t content-predictor .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8050:8050 content-predictor
```

**Docker Compose for multiple services:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - SUPABASE_URL=${SUPABASE_URL}
      - SUPABASE_KEY=${SUPABASE_KEY}
  
  dashboard:
    build: .
    command: python dash_app/app.py
    ports:
      - "8050:8050"
```

---

## 🔄 Step 11: Continuous Learning and Improvement

### What We're Learning
- Model retraining strategies
- A/B testing
- Performance monitoring
- Feedback loops

### Model Retraining

**When to retrain?**
- New data available
- Performance degradation
- Business requirements change

**Automated retraining:**
```python
# Check model performance daily
def check_model_performance():
    current_metrics = evaluate_current_model()
    if current_metrics['mae'] > threshold:
        retrain_model()
        log_model_update()
```

## 🎯 Final Exercise: Build Your Own Feature

Now that you understand the system, try building something new:

1. **Create a new feature** that predicts engagement based on weather data
2. **Add a new model type** (try a different algorithm)
3. **Create a new API endpoint** for trend analysis
4. **Add a new dashboard tab** for your feature

This will solidify your understanding and show you how to extend the system.

**Remember:** The best way to learn is by doing. Don't just read this guide - implement each step, experiment with the code, and build your understanding piece by piece.

Good luck on your data science journey! 🚀
